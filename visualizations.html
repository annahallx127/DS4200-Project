            <h4>Caption & Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              This sunburst diagram demonstrates how financial stress factors, such as debtor status (has debt vs. no debt),
              tuition status (fees up to date vs. not up to date), and scholarship status (has scholarship vs. no scholarship) impacts
              the final academic outcome of students in higher education. This diagram highlights that students who do experience financial
              strain with debt and unpaid tuition are more likely to drop out compared to students without debt and their fees up to 
              date. There are higher graduation rates amongst students that hold scholarships and have no debt. However, this diagram also 
              shows how even among students in debt, those students with scholarships tend to have higher graduation
              outcomes than students without scholarships, indicating the meaningful role scholarships play in keeping students
              in school. Overall, this visualization reveals that financial and academic academic outcomes are deeply interconnected
              and financial support can have a signficant impact on student success.

            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              This visualization compares student outcomes across three financial indicators: debtor status,
              scholarship status, and whether tuition fees are up to date. Across all three categories, the 
              distribution of outcomes shifts noticeably between the “Yes” and “No” groups. For example, students
              who are debtors or not up to date on tuition show a higher share of dropouts, while students without
              debt or with tuition paid tend to have a larger percentage of graduates. Scholarship holders also appear 
              to have a greater proportion of graduates compared to non-holders. These patterns suggest that the financial
              markers included in the dataset are closely associated with differences in student outcomes.

            <h4>Caption & Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              This visualization uses parents' qualification ranks as an approximation for socioeconomic
              status (SES). Lower ranks represent little or no formal schooling, while higher ranks
              correspond to advanced degrees. The blue heatmap shows where all students fall within this
              SES landscape, and the red dots highlight only those who eventually dropped out. 
              The strongest pattern in the plot is the large concentration of students in the lowest
              parental qualification range, which forms the darkest part of the heatmap. This region also
              contains the highest number of dropout cases. This suggests that students from lower-SES
              households, who often face financial constraints, fewer academic resources, and limited
              support, are at significantly higher risk of leaving university. 
              The middle SES range is much lighter in density, indicating that fewer students in the
              dataset come from families with moderate educational backgrounds. Dropout cases in this
              region are present but scattered, showing that while moderate SES provides some stability,
              it does not eliminate dropout risk. 
              At the high qualification ranks, the student population is smaller but notable. A few
              dropout cases still appear here, showing that leaving university is not exclusively a
              low-SES issue. Students from highly educated families may withdraw for non-financial
              reasons such as academic misalignment, mental health challenges, burnout, or shifting career
              interests. 
              Overall, the visualization shows that dropout is most common in low-SES groups, largely due
              to concentrated population and higher structural barriers. However, dropout also occurs
              across the entire SES spectrum, revealing that financial stability is important but not the
              only factor influencing student persistence.

            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              These four charts show how student outcomes change across different levels of academic performance in the first semester. 
              The first chart represents all students in the dataset and gives a baseline distribution, with graduates making up the largest group, 
              followed by dropouts and enrolled students. When the students are separated by the number of units they successfully completed, 
              the outcome patterns shift noticeably. High performers who complete 5-6 units have a much larger share of graduates and a smaller 
              share of dropouts compared to the overall population. Medium performers, who complete 3-4 units, show a more balanced mix of outcomes,
              with graduates, dropouts, and enrolled students all making up significant portions. The at-risk group, which consists of students who
              completed 0-2 units, looks very different from the high-performing group. In this subset, dropouts account for most of the outcomes, 
              while graduates make up only a small minority. The four charts together highlight how outcomes vary across performance levels, helping
              to show where students begin to diverge in their academic paths.

              This visualization shows how early academic performance relates to student outcomes. 
              Each point represents a student based on their first-semester average grade and the number of 
              units they passed. Students are color coded by final outcome. The dashed vertical and horizontal 
              lines mark the median grade and median approvals, forming four performance zones.
              The bottom left zone contains many dropouts, while the top right reflects stronger performance and a higher 
              likelihood of persistence. The dropdown lets the viewer focus on each outcome group.
              The added regression lines help clarify these patterns. The line for graduates slopes higher, showing that their 
              performance improves more as grades and approvals increase. The dropout line is flatter and lower, reflecting weaker 
              academic gains. The line for enrolled students sits between the two, indicating mixed progress.
              Together, the clusters and trend lines suggest that dropouts tend to start and remain lower performing, enrolled 
              students show moderate progression, and graduates display the strongest upward trajectory.

              This visualization demonstrates the relationship between first-semester academic performance and 
              student outcomes, where the x-axis indicates the number of courses a student has completed and therefore
              received an evaluation for (meaning they took their exams and were eligible for review), and the y-axis indicates
              the number of courses the student successfully received a passing grade in. Each point represents
              one student, and the lines indicate the trends for each outcome group (graduate, enrolled, and dropout). 
              Overall, a pattern showing that students who were evaluated in more courses and passed more of them in their first
              semester are far more likely to graduate is visible from this visualization. However, it also shows that students
              with very few or zero evaluations/approvals cluster heavily in the dropout group, suggesting there was
              early academic difficulty from the beginning of their journeys. Therefore, dropouts are concentrated near the
              origin of the plot, whereas graduates appear more consistently in the higher-performance regions. This reinforces the
              idea that early academic performance amplifies the existing inequalities and the issues that may impact a student's performance in the long run.

          <h4>Primary Insight</h4>
          <p>
            The visualizations reveal consistent patterns linking financial circumstances,
            early academic performance, and family background with the three student outcomes
            in this dataset. While we cannot determine the exact reasons behind each student's outcome, the patterns highlight 
            potential factors that appear closely associated with whether students graduate, stay enrolled, or drop out.
            These trends especially point to groups of students whose academic paths diverge early, often alongside financial 
            strain or first-semester academic challenges.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Major Findings</h3>
        <ul class="findings-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Finding 1:</strong> Students with debt or unpaid tuition appear more 
            frequently among dropouts, while financially stable students have a higher 
            proportion of graduates.
            <br><em>
              In the sunburst and bar charts, financial strain aligns with a higher share 
              of dropout outcomes, suggesting money-related challenges may influence how 
              students progress.
            </em>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Finding 2:</strong> Scholarship holders tend to have stronger outcomes.
            <br><em>
              Even within the groups experiencing debt or unpaid tuition, students with 
              scholarships show a larger percentage of graduates compared to those without 
              scholarship support.
            </em>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Finding 3:</strong> First-semester academic performance aligns closely 
            with final outcomes.
            <br><em>
              Students who complete and pass more courses in their first semester cluster 
              in the graduate group, while dropouts are concentrated among students with 
              fewer evaluations and approvals.
            </em>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Finding 4:</strong> Students whose parents have lower educational 
            qualifications appear more frequently in the dropout group.
            <br><em>
              The SES visualization shows higher dropout density among students whose 
              parents have limited schooling, indicating that background factors may shape 
              early academic experiences.
            </em>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Finding 5:</strong> No single feature explains student outcomes alone.
            <br><em>
              Financial factors, early performance, and socioeconomic background each show 
              patterns across different visualizations, suggesting that multiple 
              conditions interact throughout a students academic path.
            </em>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Implications for Higher Education</h3>
        <p>
          These patterns suggest that financial, academic, and background-related factors
          all matter when thinking about student persistence. For universities, this means
          that identifying students who might need extra support requires looking beyond
          just grades or financial records on their own. Paying closer attention to these
          patterns earlier, especially during the transition into the first semester, may help
          institutions offer more timely support through advising, academic resources, or
          financial guidance.
        </p>

        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <ul class="findings-list">
          <li>
            Expand financial guidance and emergency aid options for students who begin 
            their program with debt or unpaid tuition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strengthen early-semester academic support through tutoring, study workshops, 
            or structured advising for students struggling in their first term.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create targeted mentorship or transition programs for students from families 
            with lower educational backgrounds to support their adjustment to university life.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limitations & Future Work</h3>
        <p>
          This dataset comes from a single institution and does not capture factors like 
          mental health, work responsibilities, or personal circumstances that can also 
          influence academic outcomes. Future work could include additional qualitative or 
          behavioral information, or expand the analysis to multiple universities to see 
          whether these patterns remain consistent in broader contexts.
