      <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Student dropout and academic success are major concerns for higher education institutions because 
        they directly affect graduation rates, campus resources, and student well-being. Understanding why 
        some students persist while others leave early is important when designing effective retention strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Predict Students Dropout and Academic Success dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 
        gives us a detailed look at many of the factors that shape student outcomes, including financial 
        conditions, prior academic preparation, and early academic performance. With information collected 
        at the time of enrollment and during the first two semesters, the dataset provides a useful starting 
        point for exploring how different aspects of a student's background relate to whether they ultimately 
        graduate, remain enrolled, or drop out.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this project, our group focused on the variables that fall into two categories with strong ties 
        to student outcomes: financial stability and early academic performance. Instead of analyzing all 36 
        attributes individually, we selected and/or grouped the variables most relevant to these areas and 
        used visualizations to highlight the patterns that distinguish graduates, dropouts, and currently 
        enrolled students. Our goal was to describe these patterns and to identify moments 
        where early intervention might make a measurable difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        This topic is important because it shows how data science can support educational decision-making. 
        By turning institutional data into clearer insights, projects like this can help universities better 
        understand student needs and design programs that promote long-term academic success.

      <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset for this project is called "Predict Students Dropout and Academic Success," and it comes 
        from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It was created in 2021 using records from a Portuguese 
        higher education institution as part of a national effort to better understand student persistence 
        and reduce dropout rates. The data brings together information from several internal systems and 
        includes records for 4,424 undergraduate students across programs such as agronomy, nursing, 
        journalism, education, management, social services, and various technology fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are 36 attributes in total. These include details available when a student first enrolls, 
        such as family background, financial circumstances, demographic information, and previous academic 
        experience. The dataset also contains performance information from the first two semesters. The 
        variables are a mix of numerical and categorical fields arranged in a standard table format.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students in the dataset fall into one of three outcomes: Dropout, Enrolled, or Graduate. These 
        categories are not evenly distributed. Graduates make up the largest group, followed by Dropouts, 
        while Enrolled students represent the smallest share. Because the groups differ so much in size, 
        it is important to focus on percentages rather than raw counts when comparing patterns across 
        different student populations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This dataset allows us to look at multiple factors that shape a 
        student's academic path. It helps us explore how financial stability, early academic performance, 
        and prior preparation relate to whether a student ultimately graduates or leaves the institution.
