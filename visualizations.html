              This treemap demonstrates how financial stress factors, such as debtor status (has debt vs. no debt),
              tuition status (fees up to date vs. not up to date), and scholarship status (has scholarship vs. no scholarship) impacts
              the final academic outcome of students in higher education. This diagram contains a nested hierarchy, and it highlights that students who do experience financial
              strain with debt and unpaid tuition are more likely to drop out compared to students without debt and their fees up to 
              date. There are higher graduation rates amongst students that hold scholarships and have no debt. However, this diagram also 
              shows how even among students in debt, those students with scholarships tend to have higher graduation
              outcomes than students without scholarships, indicating the meaningful role scholarships play in keeping students
              in school. Overall, this visualization reveals that financial and academic academic outcomes are deeply interconnected
              and financial support can have a signficant impact on student success.

            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              This visualization compares student outcomes across three financial indicators: debtor status,
              scholarship status, and whether tuition fees are up to date. Across all three categories, the 
              distribution of outcomes shifts noticeably between the “Yes” and “No” groups. For example, students
              who are debtors or not up to date on tuition show a higher share of dropouts, while students without
              debt or with tuition paid tend to have a larger percentage of graduates. Scholarship holders also appear 
              to have a greater proportion of graduates compared to non-holders. These patterns suggest that the financial
              markers included in the dataset are closely associated with differences in student outcomes.

            Use the dropdown menu to explore different socioeconomic levels 
            (All, Low, Mid, High SES) and filter by student outcomes 
            (dropout, enrolled, or graduate) to compare how these groups 
            appear across the education landscape.

            <h4>Caption & Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              This visualization uses parents' qualification ranks as an approximation for socioeconomic
              status (SES). Lower ranks represent little or no formal schooling, while higher ranks
              correspond to advanced degrees. The blue heatmap shows where all students fall within this
              SES landscape, and the red dots highlight only those who eventually dropped out. 
              The strongest pattern in the plot is the large concentration of students in the lowest
              parental qualification range, which forms the darkest part of the heatmap. This region also
              contains the highest number of dropout cases. This suggests that students from lower-SES
              households, who often face financial constraints, fewer academic resources, and limited
              support, are at significantly higher risk of leaving university. 
              The middle SES range is much lighter in density, indicating that fewer students in the
              dataset come from families with moderate educational backgrounds. Dropout cases in this
              region are present but scattered, showing that while moderate SES provides some stability,
              it does not eliminate dropout risk. 
              At the high qualification ranks, the student population is smaller but notable. A few
              dropout cases still appear here, showing that leaving university is not exclusively a
              low-SES issue. Students from highly educated families may withdraw for non-financial
              reasons such as academic misalignment, mental health challenges, burnout, or shifting career
              interests. 
              Overall, the visualization shows that dropout is most common in low-SES groups, largely due
              to concentrated population and higher structural barriers. However, dropout also occurs
              across the entire SES spectrum, revealing that financial stability is important but not the
              only factor influencing student persistence.

      <p>
        These four charts show how student enrollment levels relate to academic outcomes.
        The “All Students” view provides a baseline, where graduates make up the majority,
        followed by dropouts and enrolled students. When broken down by the number of classes
        passed in the first semester, the differences become clearer: high performers show
        a strong concentration of graduates, medium performers display more mixed outcomes,
        and at-risk students see much higher dropout proportions. This interactive chart
        highlights how early academic performance aligns with long-term trajectories.

              This visualization shows how early academic performance relates to student outcomes. 
              Each point represents a student based on their first-semester average grade and the number of 
              units they passed. Students are color coded by final outcome. The dashed vertical and horizontal 
              lines mark the median grade and median approvals, forming four performance zones.
              The bottom left zone contains many dropouts, while the top right reflects stronger performance and a higher 
              likelihood of persistence. The dropdown lets the viewer focus on each outcome group.
              The added regression lines help clarify these patterns. The line for graduates slopes higher, showing that their 
              performance improves more as grades and approvals increase. The dropout line is flatter and lower, reflecting weaker 
              academic gains. The line for enrolled students sits between the two, indicating mixed progress.
              Together, the clusters and trend lines suggest that dropouts tend to start and remain lower performing, enrolled 
              students show moderate progression, and graduates display the strongest upward trajectory.

              This visualization demonstrates the relationship between first-semester academic performance and 
              student outcomes, where the x-axis indicates the number of courses a student has completed and therefore
              received an evaluation for (meaning they took their exams and were eligible for review), and the y-axis indicates
              the number of courses the student successfully received a passing grade in. Each point represents
              one student, and the lines indicate the trends for each outcome group (graduate, enrolled, and dropout). 
              Overall, a pattern showing that students who were evaluated in more courses and passed more of them in their first
              semester are far more likely to graduate is visible from this visualization. However, it also shows that students
              with very few or zero evaluations/approvals cluster heavily in the dropout group, suggesting there was
              early academic difficulty from the beginning of their journeys. Therefore, dropouts are concentrated near the
              origin of the plot, whereas graduates appear more consistently in the higher-performance regions. This reinforces the
              idea that early academic performance amplifies the existing inequalities and the issues that may impact a student's performance in the long run.
