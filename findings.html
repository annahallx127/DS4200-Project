        <h4>Primary Insight</h4>
        <p>
          The visualizations reveal consistent patterns linking financial circumstances,
          early academic performance, and family background with the three student outcomes
          in this dataset. While we cannot determine the exact reasons behind each student's
          outcome, the patterns highlight potential factors that appear closely associated
          with whether students graduate, stay enrolled, or drop out.
        </p>

      <h3>Major Findings</h3>

      <ul class="findings-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Finding 1:</strong> Students with debt or unpaid tuition appear more 
          frequently among dropouts, while financially stable students have a higher 
          proportion of graduates.
          <br><em>Financial strain aligns with a higher share of dropout outcomes in multiple visualizations.</em>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Finding 2:</strong> Scholarship holders tend to have stronger outcomes.
          <br><em>Students with scholarships show a larger percentage of graduates compared to those without support.</em>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Finding 3:</strong> First-semester academic performance aligns closely with final outcomes.
          <br><em>Graduates cluster among students with more evaluations and approvals; dropouts cluster among those with fewer.</em>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Finding 4:</strong> Students whose parents have lower educational qualifications appear more frequently in the dropout group.
          <br><em>Background factors may shape early academic experiences.</em>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Finding 5:</strong> No single feature explains student outcomes alone.
          <br><em>Financial, academic, and socioeconomic factors intersect throughout a student’s academic path.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Implications for Higher Education</h3>
      <p>
        These patterns suggest that financial, academic, and background-related factors all matter when thinking about
        student persistence. Identifying students who may need support requires more than grades or financial records alone.
        Paying attention to these indicators early—especially in the transition into the first semester—may help institutions
        offer timely advising, academic assistance, or financial guidance.
      </p>

      <h3>Recommendations</h3>
      <ul class="findings-list">
        <li>Expand financial guidance and emergency aid for students entering with debt or unpaid tuition.</li>
        <li>Strengthen early-semester academic support for students struggling in their first term.</li>
        <li>Offer mentorship or transition programs for students from families with lower educational backgrounds.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Limitations & Future Work</h3>
      <p>
        This dataset comes from one institution and does not capture personal, mental health, or work-related factors.
        Future work could include additional qualitative or behavioral information or expand to multiple institutions to
        assess whether these patterns remain consistent.
